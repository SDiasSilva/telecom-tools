                        This class has the methods CriaSplitButtons() and

                        <h4>CriaSplitButtons()</h4>
                        <p>
                            This method called "CriaSplitButtons" creates and configures a "ComboBox" to display error
                            correction level options. The method is public and does not return a value. It receives a
                            "comboBox" parameter, which is the ComboBox object to be configured.

                            The method starts by creating a new string collection using the "StringCollection" class.
                            Then, it adds the four error correction levels (H, L, M, and Q) to the collection, along
                            with a prefix of "Level -" for each one. After that, it removes the "SelectedIndexChanged"
                            event handler from the ComboBox and adds it again, setting the
                            "ComboBox_SelectedIndexChanged" event handler.

                            Next, it clears the items in the ComboBox and adds the string collection to the ComboBox,
                            converting the strings to objects. Then, the method sets a pre-selected index of 2 (the M
                            level), and if the pre-selected index is within the bounds of the ComboBox items, the method
                            sets the selected index of the ComboBox to the pre-selected index. Otherwise, it sets the
                            selected index to -1.
                        </p>

                            The "ComboBox_SelectedIndexChanged" method is an event handler for the
                            "SelectedIndexChanged" event of the ComboBox. When the user selects an item in the ComboBox,
                            the method is called and determines which item was selected. Then, it sets the corresponding
                            error correction level in the "ErrorCorrectionLevel" class based on the selected item. The
                            error correction level is determined by the values "H", "L", "M", and "Q" for the four items
                            in the ComboBox.

                            This method called "CriaSplitButtons" creates and configures a ComboBox to display options
                            for module width. The method is public and does not return a value. It receives a parameter
                            "comboBox", which is the ComboBox object to be configured.

                            The method starts by creating a new string collection using the "StringCollection" class.
                            Then, it uses a loop to add four strings representing module width values to the collection.
                            The loop also removes and adds the "SelectedIndexChanged" event handler to the ComboBox each
                            time an item is added.

                            Next, it clears the items in the ComboBox and adds the collection of strings to the
                            ComboBox, converting the strings to objects. The method sets a pre-selected index of 3
                            (representing a module width of 4), and if the pre-selected index is within the bounds of
                            the ComboBox items, the method sets the ComboBox's selected index to the pre-selected index.
                            Otherwise, it sets the selected index to -1.

                            this method is called and sets the module width based on the selected index of the ComboBox.
                            The module width is determined by adding 1 to the selected index, and the value is set using
                            the "SetModuleWidth" method in the "ModuleWidth" class.

                        checks if the number of elements in each list matches. If yes, it creates an output directory

                        using the data and provided configuration, and generates a PNG image from the QR code. If the
                        "Include logo" option is selected, it adds the logo to the QR code image. The file name is the

                        CheckBox that indicates whether the user wants to compress the images into a ZIP file. The
                        method checks if the CheckBox is checked and, if it is, iterates over all PNG images in the
                        directory and adds them to the ZIP file using the ZipFile class from the System.IO.Compression
                        library. The method uses the "Optimal" compression level and adds a 1-second pause after
                        creating the ZIP file.

                        unchecked. If these conditions are met, the method iterates over all PNG files in the directory

                        It displays a dialog box with a message asking if the user wants to open the directory. If the
                        user clicks "Yes," the method uses the Process class from the System.Diagnostics library to open
                        the specified directory.</p>

                        indicates whether the user wants to add a logo and a QR code image. The method checks if the
                        CheckBox is checked and, if it is, loads a logo image from the Resources folder of the program
                        and resizes it proportionally to a size that corresponds to 1/5 of the width of the QR code
                        image. Then, it positions the logo centered on the QR code image and returns it with the logo
                        added. The method uses the Graphics class from the System.Drawing library to draw the logo on
                        the QR code image.</p>
